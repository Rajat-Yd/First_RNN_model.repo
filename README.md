RNN model based on kaggle dataset of Age and gender. This repo demonstrate simple non linear neural network.
# What is non linear NN ? :
- A nonlinear neural network is a neural network that uses nonlinear transformations in its layers, such as activation functions, convolution, or pooling.
- An activation function is a function that adds nonlinearity to the output of a neuron, such as a sigmoid, tanh, or relu function.
